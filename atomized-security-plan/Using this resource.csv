Pay special attention to make suggestions that are compatible with the organization's existing infrastructure and way of thinking.High level leadership is important to get early in the support process."An organization is aware of its risk Ð use the way that other risks are managed and framed to translate the threats, and importance of digital to higher ups.""Identify organizational perspectives that can make security risk tangible [liability, reputational, embarrassment, financial, physical harm, recruitment]""Build the right follow-up structure that takes into consideration skills, turnover, time, changing priorities, changing contexts, changing activities, funding, drifting training goals.""Don't become inflexible. If it isn't working be open to changing it, and always welcome different approaches for different types of organizations.""Be prepared to take risks in the judgements you make. Their is no perfect approach, and the worst case scenario is that you try and get an organization to be perfect so you don't end up changing them at all."Place emphasis on business continuity. Ensure you conduct crisis simulation with information communication security as part of the failure in scenarios.
